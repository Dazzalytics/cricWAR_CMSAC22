# cricWAR
cricWAR is a project aimed at creating new metrics for evaluating player performance in the limited-overs cricket.

We are interested in evaluating the individual player's performance with (w/o) context and how it contirbuted to the success of team. Inspired by baseball analytics, we develop metrics

- Run Value (RV)
- Runs Above Average (RAA)
- Value over Repalcement Player (VoRP)
- Wins Above Replacement (WAR)
